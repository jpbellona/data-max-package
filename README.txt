ABOUT
Data-x.x.x is a Max package created by Jon Bellona (http://jpbellona.com). The package includes various objects for data-mapping projects. Data.* objects primarily extend native Max objects for working with digital musical instruments.


INSTALLATION
To install, place the ‘data-x.x.x’ folder inside 'Max X > packages' directory. Then restart Max. 
You will then have access to all data.* objects.


HOW TO USE
Inside a Max window, you may type ‘D’ (that's shift-D) to quickly access these tools (bpatcher @name data.*), or create a new object, start typing “data” and let autocomplete help you do the rest. All data.* objects contain helpfiles, with attribute and methods reference, as well as links to other relevant objects in the package.
